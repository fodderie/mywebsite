         <p>I had all it tools needed to design my website. The website would need more improvement.</p>

          <p>the improvement of the website we need is to add more style on the site and make it accessible for other users.</p>
          
          <p>My website outcome match requirement and are fit for purpose.
          The benefits IT tools we can work as a team because you can use Git and Github to get update anything that as the change to the website.

          The issues that people with disabilities depend on the type of disability. The blend wouldnâ€™t able to read or navigate around my website. In future, I would; like to upgrade my website to disabilities accessible.</p>
          
         <p> I believe HyperText Markup (HTML) is the perfect language to build your website. With HTML you can tags also can be used to define headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and interactive forms.</p>
