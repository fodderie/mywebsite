                          <p>Technology has important effects on business operations. No matter the size of your enterprise, 
                             technology has both tangible and intangible benefits that will help your business to success.</p>

                          <p>the first step to actual project success, but there are other important factors that contribute largely to a project’s outcome.
                             It takes careful planning, attention to detail and effective communication to make a project succeed. the core project staff,
                             expert resources, suppliers and all stakeholders should be part of the team dynamic. All of those involved must have a commitment to the group, 
                             share similar visions for the projects and strive for overall success.
                            Use a software tool to get everyone online and using a central repository of information. Tools like Trello not only allow you to manage the To-Dos and Project plans,
                             but will also allow you to set the availability of your resources, and then book their time on specific tasks/projects.

                             I used the Trello platform to plan my website project, by having three columns of; need Doing, Doing and DO. 
                             Which it helps me to keep on what needs to be done next.

                          <p> Digital projects are inherently a risky proposition. 
                              A lot fails. It’s natural. Part of this is just the nature of innovation, 
                              we have to make a lot of rubbish to get something good. 
                              And as technology becomes more closely entwined with every aspect of a business,
                             digital projects require more planning, more collaboration, and more buy-in than ever before.

                           <p>
                                Fundamentally, technology is a tool that helps you do what you do better, faster, or more efficiently. The key to choosing the right technology for your business is to understand what you’re already doing well, 
                                and what you need to do better. 
                                Figuring out your company’s biggest pain points is the key to knowing where you can improve, and that process starts with talking to your team.

                                Knowing your legal rights and responsibilities are important to anyone who publishes online. A basic understanding of copyright principles is essential for any blogger, researcher, reporter, photographer, or anyone who publishes their creative works. 
                                It’s important for two reasons. First, you should understand how you can properly make use of someone else’s work quoting from it, reprinting it, summarizing it, even satirizing it. And second, you should understand how you can protect your own legal rights in what you create, 
                                so that others don’t take unfair even unlawful advantage of it.
                                Constraints and Assumptions are identified and documented at high-level during project initiation. 
                                They are refined and documented in detail as a part of the Define Scope process in project planning. They are inputs to many project management processes.
