                             technology has both tangible and intangible benefits that will help your business to success. tech help increase productivity, allow for better business decision-making and ease a company's expansion into new territories or countries.

                          <p>the first step to actual project success, but there are other important factors that contribute largely to a project’s outcome.
                             It takes careful planning, attention to detail and effective communication to make a project succeed. the core project staff,
                             expert resources, suppliers and all stakeholders should be part of the team dynamic. All of those involved must have a commitment to the group, 
                             share similar visions for the projects and strive for overall success.
                            Use a software tool to get everyone online and using a central repository of information. Tools like Trello not only allow you to manage the To-Dos and Project plans,
                             but will also allow you to set the availability of your resources, and then book their time on specific tasks/projects.

                          <p> Digital projects are inherently a risky proposition. 
                              A lot fails. It’s natural. Part of this is just the nature of innovation, 
                              we have to make a lot of rubbish to get something good. 
                              And as technology becomes more closely entwined with every aspect of a business,
                             digital projects require more planning, more collaboration, and more buy-in than ever before.
                             there are a few specific risks worth looking out for when it comes to digital projects:
                             Ignoring business processes, Failing to secure complete executive buy-in, 
                             Investing in sizzle instead of solving business objectives or improving customer experiences,
                             ,Poor project definition,expectation setting and Bad vendor selection There are lots of things you can do to make your digital project go off without a hitch. 
                             Here’s our digital project success checklist.

                           <p>
                                Fundamentally, technology is a tool that helps you do what you do better, faster, or more efficiently. The key to choosing the right technology for your business is to understand what you’re already doing well, 
                                and what you need to do better. Figuring out your company’s biggest pain points is the key to knowing where you can improve, 
                                and that process starts with talking to your team.
